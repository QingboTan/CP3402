<h1>CP3402/CP5637 - Assignment 1 - Startup</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Qingbo Tan</p>
<h2>Goal/s</h2>
<p>The goal of the website is to provide, promote, and explain the features of our mental health support services (individual counseling, group therapy, online counseling). It also specifies the benefits of each service for users to choose and sign up using the contact form. The website introduces the team behind the project along with their passion and experience in the field of mental health.</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Add URLs (and modify CMS names if you've used different CMSs).</p>
<ul>
    <li>WordPress site: <a href="https://qingbotsgedu.wordpress.com/">Mental Health Support</a></li>
    <li>Joomla site: <a href="https://qingbotan.joomla.com/">Mental Health Support</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Plugins</h2>
<p>List what plugins you used with their URLs and a very brief description of what you used them for.<br>
    It should be obvious from this how/where they are used on your site.</p>
<ul>
    <li>WordPress site: Kali Forms - <a href="https://www.kaliforms.com/">kaliforms.com</a> - this plug-in allowed me to create a basic contact form.</li>
    <li>Joomla site: JD Simple Contact Form - <a href="https://www.joomdev.com/">Joomdev.com</a> - I used this plug-in to create a simple contact form</li>
    <li>Joomla site: Akeeba Backup for Joomla - <a href="https://www.akeeba.com/">akeeba.com</a> - I used this extension to export the website content.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reflection and Insights</h2>
<p>Describe your experience using the two different CMSs.<br>
    What have you learned through this assignment regarding the different systems?</p>

    <p>
        In the beginning of this project, I encountered several challenges while trying to follow instructions related to local development areas, particularly with version and compatibility issues. Despite these setbacks, I persevered and opted for a different method that I was more familiar with. By updating my knowledge and utilizing the latest software versions, I successfully created a local development environment. Uploading the work to the hosting platform then became a straightforward process.<br>
        <br>
        For the WordPress aspect of the project, I developed the website entirely online and updated the content based on the same information provided by the gym. Comparing both CMSs, I found that the choice of theme can significantly impact the project. However, WordPress offers simpler and clearer ways to access various parts of the website. For example, managing menus is much easier in WordPress compared to Joomla.<br>
        <br>
        Through this assignment, I learned that while both WordPress and Joomla have their strengths, WordPress tends to offer a more intuitive and user-friendly experience, especially for tasks such as managing menus and other website components. The choice of theme is crucial in both systems and can greatly influence the overall ease of use and functionality of the website.<br>
